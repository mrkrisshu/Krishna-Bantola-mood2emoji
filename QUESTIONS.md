# Questions for Codingal Team

## 1. Age-Appropriate Safety List
**Question**: Should the bad-words filter be customizable by teachers/admins, or would Codingal prefer a centralized, curriculum-approved safety list?

**Why this matters**: Different schools and regions may have different standards for appropriate language. A customizable filter would allow teachers to adapt the tool to their specific classroom needs.

## 2. Data Privacy & Student Inputs
**Question**: For a production version, would student sentences be stored for improvement purposes, or should this be a zero-data-retention tool for privacy?

**Why this matters**: Educational tools for minors require careful consideration of data privacy (COPPA, FERPA). I've designed this as a stateless app, but understanding Codingal's data policy would help with future enhancements.

## 3. Multilingual Support Roadmap
**Question**: Is there interest in extending Mood2Emoji to support languages beyond English (e.g., Hindi, Spanish) for Codingal's global student base?

**Why this matters**: Sentiment analysis accuracy varies by language. Planning for multilingual support would influence the choice of libraries and model architecture from the start.
